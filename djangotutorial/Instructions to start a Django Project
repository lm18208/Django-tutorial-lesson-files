pip install Django (or just 'pip install -r requirements.txt' if you have already downloaded my requirements file)
django-admin startproject [Name of your Choice, I will choose Django-tutorial]

cd [previous directory] e.g. Django-tutorial

'django-admin' to reveal list of django commands 
python manage.py runserver to test functionality, you should be greeted by django's debug screen if you click on the address

some may need to use python3 instead of python depending on your file structure
