How to start a djnago project

This is the proper method to begin a django project. 
To make things easier however I have provided a boilerplate project template that you can download in the djangotemplate branch 

It is however important to know how to begin a project.

1. Initiate your venv or start project in pycharm (or vscode)

2. pip install Django 

# (or just 'pip install -r requirements.txt' if you have already downloaded my requirements file)

# (I like storing my versions for all of my libraries in a requirements.txt file, 
# this just makes it easier to install all the nescessary extensions at once 
# which is especially handy when moving your program to a new environment)

3. django-admin startproject [Name of your Choice e.g. Django-tutorial]

4. cd [directory e.g. Django-tutorial] 

you can enter 'django-admin' to reveal list of django commands 
5. python manage.py runserver # to test functionality, you should be greeted by django's debug screen when you open the address in the browser

# some may need to use python3 instead of python depending on your file structure

6. create a super user to login to the admin

python3 manage.py createsuperuser #and enter a username and password. This will be used to sign in in the admin path/admin (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8000/admin)
