# create a model in models.py for example:

class mymodel(models.Models):
  number = models.IntegerField()
  
  
# always run migrations after changing models.py. 
# python3 manage.py makemigrations
# python3 manage.py migrate


# After creating the model you need to register it in the admin.py file

from .models import mymodel

admin.site.register(mymodel)

# This will make your model visible in the django admin
