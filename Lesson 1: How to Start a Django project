How to start a djnago project

This is the proper method to begin a django project. 
To make things easier however I have provided a boilerplate project template that you can download in the projecttemplate branch
Download this as a zip file and add it to your project folder. Skip the django start project step.

It is however important to know how to begin a project.

1. Initiate your venv or start project in pycharm (or vscode)

2. Install Django

    pip install Django 
    
    # alternatively

    pip install -r requirements.txt # if you have created a requirements.txt file listing your extensions

    # It is a really good habit to list all your extensions in a requirements.txt file, 
    # this just makes it easier to install all the nescessary extensions at once using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
    # which is especially handy when moving your program to a new environment

3. Start a project and cd into your project directory

   django-admin startproject [Name of your Choice e.g. Django-tutorial]
   cd [directory e.g. Django-tutorial] 

tip: you can enter 'django-admin' to reveal list of django commands 

4. Test to see if this worked using:

    python manage.py runserver # you should be greeted by django's debug screen when you open the address in the browser

tip: some may need to use python3 instead of python depending on your file structure (I DID

5. create a super user to login to the admin

    python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
    
    # enter a username and password. This will be used to sign in in the admin 
    # To see the admin enter path/admin (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8000/admin) in your browser once your server is running
