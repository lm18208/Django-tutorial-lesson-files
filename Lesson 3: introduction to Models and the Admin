Lesson 3: introduction to Models and the Admin

1. create a model in models.py for example:

    class mymodel(models.Models):
      text = models.CharField(max_length=30)
      number = models.IntegerField()

  
A ist of Django model data types (e.g. Charfield, DecimalField) can be found here: https://www.webforefront.com/django/modeldatatypesandvalidation.html

# always run migrations in the terminal after changing models.py. 
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate


2. After creating the model you need to register it in the admin.py file

    from .models import mymodel

    admin.site.register(mymodel)

    # This will make your model visible in the django admin
    
3. you can now play with creating objects with that model in the admin
