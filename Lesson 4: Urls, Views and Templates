Views, urls and templates work together as a process to render data

the main process works like this:
templates > urls > views > templates

urls are entered by the user from buttons or links in your templates. These link to a url path in your app. 
This path executes a view which will pull and operate data to be displayed in the templates (I will go over this later when we discuss views)
This view will then render a template which the user will see as a page.
