lesson-2 notes

to start your first app execute:
python3 manage.py startapp [your app name]

you should see the folowing files appear in the folder for your new app

__init__.py
admin.py
apps.py
models.py
tests.py
views.py

now I want you to add an additional file to the app folder named urls.py. (right click and create new python file)

Within it add the following lines
'''
  from django.urls import path
  from .views import *

  app_name = '[your app name]'

  urlpatterns = [

  ]
'''

Now in the other urls.py where your settings folder is located, add the following line in urlpatterns = [...
'''
  path('', include('[your app name].urls', namespace='[your app name]'))
'''

this will link your app urls to your main urls

now the only files you need to worry about right now are:

models.py : this is where you create your database models and functions for those models

models are object types that can be stored in the database

admin.py : this is where you register data from your app in the admin, this is mainly just where you choose which models are visible in the admin
views.py : this is where you choose and format data to be displayed in templates, what is seen from the user end.
urls.py : created by you earlier, this is where you manage your app paths

the main process works like this:
templates > urls > views > templates

urls are entered by the user from buttons or links in your templates. These link to a url path in your app. 
This path executes a view which will pull and operate data to be displayed in the templates (I will go over this later when we discuss views)
This view will then render a template which the user will see as a page.
